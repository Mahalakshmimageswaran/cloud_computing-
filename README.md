diabetes prediction ,  ( cloud computing team project )
Diabetes prediction is an important task in healthcare to identify individuals at risk and provide timely intervention. Random Forest, a popular ensemble learning algorithm, has been widely used for predictive modeling due to its ability to handle high-dimensional datasets and capture complex relationships between features and outcomes. In this study, we applied the Random Forest algorithm to predict diabetes. The dataset used for training and testing the model consisted of features such as glucose level, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, and other relevant clinical variables. The Random Forest classifier was trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on the remaining samples. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess the model's predictive ability. The results showed that the Random Forest algorithm achieved high accuracy in predicting diabetes, demonstrating its effectiveness as a reliable tool for diabetes prediction. The findings of this study have the potential to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes and guiding preventive measures and interventions.
